bce-simulation
===

bce-simulation is a set of simulations written for a research project regarding Buffon's Coin Experiment and a couple of its variants. It serves to verify theoretical findings through experimental methods.

The simulations are focused on speed and will be able to handle millions of simulations easily. A multithreaded implementation will be written soon.
