# bce-simulation [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/wei2912/bce-simulation.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/wei2912/bce-simulation)

bce-simulation is a set of simulations written for a research project regarding Buffon's Coin Experiment and a couple of its variants. It serves to verify theoretical findings through experimental methods.

## Website

The [website](https://wei2912.github.io/bce-simulation) for the simulation is currently a WIP and is available on the branch `gh-pages`.

Preferably, it should send requests to a server hosted somewhere which will then run the trials and return the results.
